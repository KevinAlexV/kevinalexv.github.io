npm start project and customize it.
Deploy on github-pages using npm run deploy command.
⚠️ Note that:
- if you want to have portfolio on different repository than `{username}.github.io`, 
set `homepage` in `package.json` to `https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}/` 
before deploying portfolio.
- if you want to run it locally with npm run start, make sure that you have edited 
homepage property or json data won't load.
