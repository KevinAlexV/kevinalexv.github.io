					<p>
						Kevin! I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast engrossed and captivated by the field of I.T. <br><br>
						While there's a lot encompassed under that subject, I find myself particularly interested in programming -
						A passion that started in high school, all in front of a very old Dell monitor displaying some version of Eclipse, allowing me to program a video game in Java.<br>

					<p>
						I'm sure our teacher was trying to replicate the tales of Markus Persson and his first time programming, but nevertheless, it started my 
						journey into this fantastical world of solving logical puzzles posed by the challenges set out by employers and myself.
						Thus, I  worked on several personal projects in my spare time, while attending university to expand upon my wealth of coding knowledge.

						<p class="description"><b>Shadowrun</b>, Fifth Edition is the newest version of this role-playing game.
							With rules for character creation, magic, combat, Matrix hacking, rigging, 
							and more, you have everything you need to face the challenges of the Sixth World.

						<p class="description">
							This edition of Shadowrun takes place in 2075, a future long after an event called the 'awakening'.
							That event cause the world of technology to collide with the world of magic. The age when Elfs began
							to materialize, and where magic and dragons were no longer fiction.

					</div>
					<p>
						Over the years, dating back from High School, I've mostly focused on personal projects. However, that changed through my recent endevours in a Games Development program, where
						my focus shifted towards producing small games and related experiences.<br><br>
						Regardless of my ventures in games development, I've worked in two sub-categories of I.T.: Programming and Security (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive).<br><br>
						While the security mindset has been ingrained in me, I frequently rediverted my attention to programming (even within some of the work I've done in I.T. Security). Thus, I honed
						quite a few skills.

						Admittedly, I still spent a lot of my time playing the various video games that inspired me to focus my attention to their development.<br><br>
						Though, I find myself frequently reflecting on the different skillsets that I managed to develop through these games. Whether it be level design or
						teamwork, I was always furthering my techniques.
