					<p>
						Kevin! I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast engrossed and captivated by the field of I.T. <br><br>
						While there's a lot encompassed under that subject, I find myself particularly interested in programming -
						A passion that started in high school, all in front of a very old Dell monitor displaying some version of Eclipse, allowing me to program a video game in Java.<br><br>

					<h4>The biggest lesson was 'Iterate, Iterate, Iterate'.</h4>
					<p>
						I'm sure our teacher was trying to replicate the tales of Markus Persson and his first time programming, but nevertheless, it started my 
						journey into this fantastical world of solving logical puzzles posed by the challenges set out by employers and myself.
						Thus, I  worked on several personal projects in my spare time, while attending university to expand upon my wealth of coding knowledge.

						Over the years, dating back from High School, I've mostly focused on personal projects. However, that changed through my recent endevours in a Games Development program, where
