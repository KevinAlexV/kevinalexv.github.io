      "description": "Kevin! I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast engrossed and captivated by the field of I.T. \nWhile there's a lot encompassed under that subject, I find myself particularly interested in programming - A passion that started in high school, all in front of a very old Dell monitor displaying some version of Eclipse, allowing me to program a video game in Java.\n\nAfter creating the enemy art and assembling the core logic, the biggest lesson was 'Iterate, Iterate, Iterate'.\n\nI'm sure our teacher was trying to replicate the tales of Markus Persson and his first time programming, but nevertheless, it started my journey into this fantastical world of solving logical puzzles posed by the challenges set out by employers and myself. Thus, I  worked on several personal projects in my spare time, while attending university to expand upon my wealth of coding knowledge.",

      "skills_description":"Over the years, dating back from High School, I've mostly focused on personal projects. However, that changed through my recent endevours in a  Games Development program, where my focus shifted towards producing small games and related experiences.\n\nBy far, I've worked in Games Development and Security.\n\nWhile the security mindset has been ingrained in me, I frequently focused my efforts in programming, which was the connecting factor between Games Dev and Security. I honed quite a few skills as a result:",
      "skills_description_2":"Admittedly, I still spent a lot of my time playing the various video games that inspired me to focus my attention to their development.\n\nThough, I find myself frequently reflecting on the different skillsets that I managed to develop through these games. Whether it be level design through game creators (like Mario Maker) or teamwork via co-op shooters (such as Call Of Duty: Zombies), I was always furthering my techniques.",
      "projects_description":"While I've worked on several personal projects, I began producing more presentable projects over the past few years. Here are a few highlights of those projects:"

The hope is to explore the many applications of an AI designed in this way, whether it be for a game mechanic or to help developers adjust the tone of their game by simply changing the music. This is being built in Unreal 5 with Blueprints and C++, and will be completed in April 2023.",

The email, from the same script, would then contain the instructions needed for an employee to setup their token to start working from home. \n\nThis script spared several days worth of work from our security team, and allowed them to focus on troubleshooting VPN connections. It easily covered over 2000 employees, and allowed them to get working from home quicker than would normally have been possible. ",
